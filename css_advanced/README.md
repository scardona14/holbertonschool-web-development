- **How to add style to an element**: You can add styles using inline styles, internal CSS, or external CSS.
- **What is a class?**: A class is a reusable style definition that can be applied to multiple elements.
- **What is a selector?**: A selector is a pattern used to select the elements you want to style.
- **How to compute CSS Specificity Value**: Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied by the browser when multiple rules could apply to the same element.
- **What are Box properties in CSS?**: Box properties include margin, border, padding, and content, which define the spacing and borders around elements.
- **How does the browser load a webpage?**: The browser parses HTML, builds the Document Object Model (DOM) tree, fetches and applies CSS, and executes JavaScript.
